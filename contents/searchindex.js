"\t\t\n6 Initializing the ADEV\nTurning the ADEV On\nPress the POWER Button on the top of the ADEV console.\nIf the ADEV is off and you connect it to a PC, the power turns on automatically.\n Note\n The ADEV must be sufficiently charged in advance. We recommend charging for at least an hour.\n If the battery runs low during initialization, the update might fail.\nConnecting the ADEV to a PC\nConnect the USB charging cable to the PC's USB port and the USB Type-C terminal on the bottom of the ADEV console.\n Note\n Do not use the Relay Box-A during initialization.\n If the Relay Box-A is used during initialization, the update might fail.\n The USB driver might update when the ADEV is connected to the PC.\n When the ADEV is connected to a PC, wait for a while after turning on the ADEV's power.\n If the USB driver is updated during initialization, the update might fail.\nInitializing the ADEV\nInitialize the ADEV firmware using the dedicated tool. (This process usually takes about five minutes.)\n Info\n Warning messages about the Windows Firewall are displayed several times during this process. Select Allow access.\n \tStep \tOperation\n \t1 \t Note the code written on the sticker applied to the back of the stand.\n (Enter the ADEV serial number in the \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\" part of the following image.)\n Info\n The serial number is used to select the ADEV in step 3.\n \t2 \t On the NintendoSDK management screen, click Initialize the ADEV.\n Info\n To display the NintendoSDK management screen, from the Nintendo Dev Interface Welcome screen, select Dev Environments > Manage.\n \t3 \t Select the ADEV you want to initialize and begin initialization.\n From the list of connected ADEV units shown in 1. Select ADEV actual equipment, click to select the one with the Serial value that matches the serial number you noted in step 1.\n Under 2. Select firmware variation, in the combo box, select the firmware version to use.\n Info\n We strongly recommend selecting the firmware that was initially suggested, without any changes.\n Before selecting + Prod or + ProdWithLog, read NintendoSDK Documents > Guide to Setting Up the Environment > More Information > Firmware That Approximates Retail Hardware > Initialization for PROD MODE.\n Next, to start ADEV initialization, in 3. Start ADEV initialization, click Start initialization.\n Info\n When the ADEV console is in safe mode, an entry that reads (Safe Mode) appears in the Name column.\n To start initialization, select that entry and click Start initialization.\n Info\n The log pauses for 80 to 90 seconds during this process. Wait for the log to resume.\n The process may have failed if the log does not resume after several minutes.\n Info\n If the ADEV console you want to initialize does not appear on the ADEV connection list even after restarting and clicking Re-Scan, something might be wrong with the ADEV. For more information, see 6.1 When ADEV Initialization Fails.\n \t4 \t If Success is displayed in the lower left of the log window, click Exit to close the tool.\n Info\n Fan Operating Noise\n While executing step 3, the cooling fan inside the ADEV starts running.\nThe fan is somewhat noisy, but that does not mean the unit is malfunctioning.\n Info\n For more information about the setup, see NintendoSDK Documents > Guide to Setting Up the Environment > More Information > Other Information About Setting Up the Development Hardware.\n Info\n A sample has been built to check whether the ADEV was initialized correctly.\n Run the sample as follows.\n \tOn the NintendoSDK management screen, click Run Sample.\n \tA logo like the following is displayed if the ADEV was initialized correctly and VSI for NX was installed correctly.\n Note: This sample does not exit automatically.

However, automatic installation sometimes fails depending on the environment.\nUse the following procedure to confirm whether the ADEV device drivers are installed.\n \tTurn the ADEV on and connect it to the PC with a USB cable.\n \tOpen Device Manager on the PC.\n \tVerify that the NintendoSdkDebugger or NintendoSDK DevKit is shown in Device Manager.\nIf the ADEV device drivers are not installed, use the following procedure to install the drivers manually.\n \tIn the NintendoSDK folder, go to Installers/DevkitDriver and run dpinst.exe.\nThe procedure is now complete.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n",0,"en-US"],
["Pages/Page_1137766909.html","6.1 When ADEV Initialization Fails",
"\t\t\n6.1 When ADEV Initialization Fails\nFactors such as the ADEV status can cause initialization to fail.\n \tInitialization fails.\n \tThe ADEV console you want to initialize does not appear (or it no longer appears) on the ADEV connection list in InitializeAdevWin.\nIf this happens, verify the following.\nYou are using InitializeAdev.exe (or InitializeAdevWin.exe).\nWe recommend directly calling InitializeAdev.exe or InitializeAdevWin.exe.\nThe following files also call these functions directly.\n \t%NINTENDO_SDK_ROOT\\InitializeAdev.bat\n \t%NINTENDO_SDK_ROOT\\Tools\\CommandLineTools\\DevKitSetup.bat\n \t%NINTENDO_SDK_ROOT\\Tools\\CommandLineTools\\DevKitSetup.ps1\nVerifying the Specified Parameters\nIf you are using the InitializeAdev.exe command-line tool, verify that the specified parameters match. (The serial number works with or without a check digit.)\nVerifying Whether the Version Has Restrictions\nFirmware version 13.0.0-3.0 and later can be used for ADEV. If you try to initialize the system with an earlier version of the firmware, it fails during the process.\nRepeating Initialization\nSometimes initializing the ADEV several times results in success. Try to initialize again.\nFully Charging the ADEV Console\nTry to perform initialization after fully charging the ADEV console.\nTo charge the device you must attach the AC adapter. You cannot charge simply by connecting the device to a PC with a USB cable.\nReconnecting the USB Cable and Turning the Power On\nTry initializing the ADEV console again after reconnecting the USB cable and turning the power on.\nIf initialization is particularly unsuccessful, reconnect the USB cable with the following procedure.\n \tDisconnect the USB cable from the ADEV system.\n \tHold down the POWER Button on the upper left of the ADEV console for approximately 12 seconds to turn the power off.\n \tReconnect the USB cable to the ADEV console while the power is off.\n \tThe ADEV turns on automatically when it is connected. Try initialization again.\nIf you are using the device connected to a Relay Box-A, try connecting it directly to the PC without using the relay box.\nExiting Target Manager If It Is Running\nExit Target Manager if it is running, and then try to initialize ADEV.\nSometimes Target Manager stays in the system tray, so also check there.\nVerifying the ADEV Console Is Recognized by Device Manager\nVerify that the ADEV is recognized as a USB device in Device Manager.\nFor more information, see 6 Initializing the ADEV > ADEV Drivers.\nManually Activating Safe Mode\nSometimes initialization is successful after activating safe mode.\n Info\n Safe mode is a mode that runs with minimum features.\n Use safe mode in the following situations.\n \tThe console is not operating properly and must be restored.\n \tADEV initialization fails.\n \tThe ADEV is not detected when it is initialized.\n \tThe power is on but the system menu does not appear.\n Safe mode can be activated with user operations.\n After safe mode is activated, you may not be able to start in normal mode until the EDEV is initialized, so we recommend using safe mode only when you must restore or initialize.\nProcedures for Entering Safe Mode\nThere are two ways to enter safe mode.\n(Method 1) With Joy-Con (R) Attached\n We recommend this method.\n \tHold down the POWER Button (for approximately 12 seconds) and turn off the ADEV console with the USB cable connected. (The system restarts after the button is held down for 20 seconds, so do not go much longer than 12 seconds.)\n \tAttach the Joy-Con (R) to the ADEV console. (Do not attach the Joy-Con (L).)\n \tPress the POWER Button while holding down the volume down button.\n \tTo check whether safe mode is running, see Method for Verifying Whether the System Has Entered Safe Mode. If the system did not enter safe mode correctly, particularly when the menu screen is displayed, restart the process from step 1.\n(Method 2) Without Joy-Con Attached\n \tHold down the POWER Button (for approximately 12 seconds) and turn off the ADEV console with the USB cable connected. (The system restarts after the button is held down for 20 seconds, so do not go much longer than 12 seconds.)\n \tPress the buttons on the upper left of the console in the following order.\n\tPress the POWER Button while holding down the volume down button.\n\tWhile holding down the POWER Button, release the volume down button and press the volume up button.\n\tWhile holding down the volume up button, release the POWER Button.\n\tRelease the volume up button.\n \tTo check whether safe mode is running, see Method for Verifying Whether the System Has Entered Safe Mode. If the system did not enter safe mode correctly, particularly when the menu screen is displayed, restart the process from step 1.\n Info\n Could Not Enter Safe Mode\n For cases where the system enters the standard startup sequence and displays the menu despite attempting to enter safe mode, sometimes adjusting the intervals between button operations will fix the issue. (This is because some operations may not be detected if the intervals between button operations is too fast.)\n As a guide, try using an interval of 0.6 seconds. This interval is equivalent to 4 beat intervals at 100 beats per minute (BPM). We recommend searching for a video with \"BPM=100\" that you can use as a guide.\nVerifying Whether the System Has Entered Safe Mode\nUse the following procedure to verify whether the system has entered safe mode.\n \tIn InitializeAdevWin.exe, click Re-Scan to display the systems that are in safe mode in the list of connected systems.\n \t NX DevKit Safe Mode is displayed for four seconds on the ADEV screen immediately after startup. (Nothing is displayed afterward that point.)\nUsing USB 2.0 When USB 3.0 Connection Fails\nADEV setup may fail depending on the compatibility with the USB 3.0 controller.\nTry the following.\n \tUpdate the USB 3.0 controller driver to the latest version.\n \tUpdate the USB 3.0 controller firmware to the latest version. (Sometimes this firmware is not publicly available.)\n \tRun setup by connecting the device to a USB 2.0 port.\nSetup has been confirmed to fail when using a PC with the following USB 3.0 controller.\n \tRenesas Electronics USB 3.0 Host Controller\nContacting Support\nIf initialization is unsuccessful after attempting these procedures, contact Nintendo support.\nWhen contacting support, the process will be smoother if you include the following information.\n \tSerial number of the ADEV unit\n \tSDK/FW version\n \tInitialization log\tFor InitializeAdevWin, copy the log that appears in the log window to a text file and send in the text file.\n\tFor InitializeAdev, execute a log with the --verbose option added and save it to a file.\n \tAll of the data under the %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Nintendo directory for the PC (and user) that encountered this symptom.\tInformation such as the time of initialization is stored in this folder.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n",0,"en-US"],
