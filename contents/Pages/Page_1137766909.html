<!-- 6.1 When ADEV Initialization Fails -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_1137766909">6.1 When ADEV Initialization Fails</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<p>Factors such as the ADEV status can cause initialization to fail.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initialization fails.</li>
  <li>The ADEV console you want to initialize does not appear (or it no longer appears) on the ADEV connection list in InitializeAdevWin.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this happens, verify the following.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_1137766909_h1_1">You are using InitializeAdev.exe (or InitializeAdevWin.exe).</h1>
<p>We recommend directly calling <code>InitializeAdev.exe</code> or <code>InitializeAdevWin.exe</code>.</p>
<p>The following files also call these functions directly.</p>
<ul>
  <li>%NINTENDO_SDK_ROOT\InitializeAdev.bat</li>
  <li>%NINTENDO_SDK_ROOT\Tools\CommandLineTools\DevKitSetup.bat</li>
  <li>%NINTENDO_SDK_ROOT\Tools\CommandLineTools\DevKitSetup.ps1</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_1137766909_h1_2">Verifying the Specified Parameters</h1>
<p>If you are using the <code>InitializeAdev.exe</code> command-line tool, verify that the specified parameters match. (The serial number works with or without a check digit.)</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_1137766909_h1_3">Verifying Whether the Version Has Restrictions</h1>
<p>Firmware version 13.0.0-3.0 and later can be used for ADEV. If you try to initialize the system with an earlier version of the firmware, it fails during the process.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_1137766909_h1_4">Repeating Initialization</h1>
<p>Sometimes initializing the ADEV several times results in success. Try to initialize again.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_1137766909_h1_5">Fully Charging the ADEV Console</h1>
<p>Try to perform initialization after fully charging the ADEV console.</p>
<p>To charge the device you must attach the AC adapter. You cannot charge simply by connecting the device to a PC with a USB cable.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_1137766909_h1_6">Reconnecting the USB Cable and Turning the Power On</h1>
<p>Try initializing the ADEV console again after reconnecting the USB cable and turning the power on.</p>
<p>If initialization is particularly unsuccessful, reconnect the USB cable with the following procedure.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect the USB cable from the ADEV system.</li>
  <li>Hold down the POWER Button on the upper left of the ADEV console for approximately 12 seconds to turn the power off.</li>
  <li>Reconnect the USB cable to the ADEV console while the power is off.</li>
  <li>The ADEV turns on automatically when it is connected. Try initialization again.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using the device connected to a Relay Box-A, try connecting it directly to the PC without using the relay box.<br /></p>
<h1 id="Anchor_1137766909_h1_7">Exiting Target Manager If It Is Running</h1>
<p>Exit Target Manager if it is running, and then try to initialize ADEV.</p>
<p>Sometimes Target Manager stays in the system tray, so also check there.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_1137766909_h1_8">Verifying the ADEV Console Is Recognized by Device Manager</h1>
<p>Verify that the ADEV is recognized as a USB device in Device Manager.<br />For more information, see <a href="../Pages/Page_1137766887.html">6 Initializing the ADEV</a> &gt; ADEV Drivers.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_1137766909_h1_9">Manually Activating Safe Mode</h1>
<p>Sometimes initialization is successful after activating safe mode.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>Safe mode is a mode that runs with minimum features.</p>
    <p>Use safe mode in the following situations.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The console is not operating properly and must be restored.</li>
      <li>ADEV initialization fails.</li>
      <li>The ADEV is not detected when it is initialized.</li>
      <li>The power is on but the system menu does not appear.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Safe mode can be activated with user operations.</p>
    <p>After safe mode is activated, you may not be able to start in normal mode until the EDEV is initialized, so <strong><u>we recommend using safe mode only when you must restore or initialize</u>. </strong></p>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="Anchor_1137766909_h2_1">Procedures for Entering Safe Mode</h2>
<p>There are two ways to enter safe mode.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_1137766909_h3_1">(Method 1) With Joy-Con (R) Attached</h3>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_1137766909/1137766910.png" height="150" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <u>We recommend this method.</u>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hold down the POWER Button (<em><u>for approximately 12 seconds</u></em>) and turn off the ADEV console with the USB cable connected. (The system restarts after the button is held down for 20 seconds, so do not go much longer than 12 seconds.)</li>
  <li>Attach the Joy-Con (R) to the ADEV console. (Do not attach the Joy-Con (L).)</li>
  <li>Press the POWER Button while holding down the volume down button.</li>
  <li>To check whether safe mode is running, see Method for Verifying Whether the System Has Entered Safe Mode. If the system did not enter safe mode correctly, particularly when the menu screen is displayed, restart the process from step 1.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Anchor_1137766909_h3_2">(Method 2) Without Joy-Con Attached</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Hold down the POWER Button (<em><u>for approximately 12 seconds</u></em>) and turn off the ADEV console with the USB cable connected. (The system restarts after the button is held down for 20 seconds, so do not go much longer than 12 seconds.)</li>
  <li>Press the buttons on the upper left of the console in the following order.<br /><ol><li>Press the POWER Button while holding down the volume down button.</li><li>While holding down the POWER Button, release the volume down button and press the volume up button.</li><li>While holding down the volume up button, release the POWER Button.</li><li>Release the volume up button.</li></ol></li>
  <li>To check whether safe mode is running, see Method for Verifying Whether the System Has Entered Safe Mode. If the system did not enter safe mode correctly, particularly when the menu screen is displayed, restart the process from step 1.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>
      <strong>Could Not Enter Safe Mode</strong>
    </p>
    <p>For cases where the system enters the standard startup sequence and displays the menu despite attempting to enter safe mode, sometimes adjusting the intervals between button operations will fix the issue. (This is because some operations may not be detected if the intervals between button operations is too fast.)</p>
    <p>As a guide, try using an interval of 0.6 seconds. This interval is equivalent to 4 beat intervals at 100 beats per minute (BPM). We recommend searching for a video with &quot;BPM=100&quot; that you can use as a guide.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="Anchor_1137766909_h2_2">Verifying Whether the System Has Entered Safe Mode</h2>
<p>Use the following procedure to verify whether the system has entered safe mode.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In <code>InitializeAdevWin.exe</code>, click <strong>Re-Scan</strong> to display the systems that are in safe mode in the list of connected systems.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>NX DevKit Safe Mode</strong> is displayed for four seconds on the ADEV screen immediately after startup. (Nothing is displayed afterward that point.)</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Anchor_1137766909_h1_10">Using USB 2.0 When USB 3.0 Connection Fails</h1>
<p>ADEV setup may fail depending on the compatibility with the USB 3.0 controller.<br />Try the following.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Update the USB 3.0 controller driver to the latest version.</li>
  <li>Update the USB 3.0 controller firmware to the latest version. (Sometimes this firmware is not publicly available.)</li>
  <li>Run setup by connecting the device to a USB 2.0 port.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setup has been confirmed to fail when using a PC with the following USB 3.0 controller.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Renesas Electronics USB 3.0 Host Controller</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_1137766909_h1_11">Contacting Support</h1>
<p>If initialization is unsuccessful after attempting these procedures, contact Nintendo support.</p>
<p>When contacting support, <em><u>the process will be smoother if you include the following information.</u></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Serial number of the ADEV unit</li>
  <li>SDK/FW version</li>
  <li>Initialization log<ul><li>For <code>InitializeAdevWin</code>, copy the log that appears in the log window to a text file and send in the text file.</li><li>For <code>InitializeAdev</code>, execute a log with the <code>--verbose</code> option added and save it to a file.</li></ul></li>
  <li>All of the data under the <code>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Nintendo</code> directory for the PC (and user) that encountered this symptom.<ul><li>Information such as the time of initialization is stored in this folder.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
